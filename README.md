## Project Overview

This Android mobile app is a quiz game where users are shown a flag image along with a country name and must answer True or False to indicate whether the country matches the flag. The app provides feedback for each answer and presents a final score after five questions.
The app is designed to be fun and educational, especially for kids. After answering all questions, users can see their score, and the app keeps track of previous scores to compare performance over time.
